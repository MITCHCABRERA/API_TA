**RBAC Implementation**

RBAC is implemented across multiple files in your Django project to control user permissions and access to resources. Below is a breakdown of the relevant files and their roles:

1. permissions.py (Posts App)

Custom permission classes are usually defined in this file. If this file exists in your project, it likely contains:

IsAdminOrReadOnly: Allows only admin users to modify or delete posts/comments while permitting read access for others.

IsOwnerOrAdmin: Ensures that only the owner of a post or an admin can edit/delete it.

CanViewPost: Controls visibility of posts based on privacy settings (public vs. private).

2. views.py (Posts App)

Contains RBAC logic within API views and viewsets.

Uses IsAuthenticated, IsAdminOrReadOnly, IsOwnerOrAdmin, and CanViewPost permissions to enforce access control.

like and unlike endpoints ensure that only authenticated users can perform these actions.

Admin users have special privileges in modifying posts and comments.

3. models.py (Posts App)

User roles and ownership are indirectly handled through relationships:

author field in Post and Comment models links content to a specific user.

likes ManyToManyField enforces access control via authentication.

4. urls.py (Posts App)

Enforces RBAC at the routing level using Django REST Framework (DRF) ViewSets, which internally reference permissions.

5. serializers.py (Posts App)

Ensures that only permitted fields are exposed to users based on roles and access levels.


**Caching Implementation Overview**

1. Django Settings Configuration

Location: settings.py

Implementation: The caching mechanism should be configured in this file, specifying the caching backend (e.g., Redis, Memcached, or DatabaseCache).

2. Serializer-Level Caching

Location: serializers.py (inside posts app)

Implementation: Use caching in the PostSerializer and CommentSerializer to optimize repeated queries, such as fetching likes_count and checking liked_by_user.

3. Query Optimization in Models

Location: models.py (inside posts app)

Implementation: Methods like total_likes() in the Post model can leverage caching to avoid redundant database hits.

4. Middleware-Level Caching

Location: MIDDLEWARE section in settings.py

Implementation: Django’s UpdateCacheMiddleware and FetchFromCacheMiddleware can be added to optimize request-response cycles.

5. API View Caching

Location: views.py (inside posts app)

Implementation: Use Django’s cache_page decorator on API endpoints that serve posts and comments to reduce redundant processing.

6. Redis Integration for JWT & OAuth

Location: settings.py under SIMPLE_JWT and OAUTH2_PROVIDER

Implementation: Store access and refresh tokens in Redis to improve authentication performance.

7. Celery Task Caching (If Implemented)

Location: Background task configuration (if any Celery tasks are used for notification or post-processing)

Implementation: Use Django’s caching framework to store background task results for quick retrieval.

8. Database QuerySet Caching

Location: views.py (inside posts app)

Implementation: Implement Django’s low-level cache (cache.set and cache.get) when fetching frequently accessed posts and comments.
